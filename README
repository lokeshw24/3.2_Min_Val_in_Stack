>PROG :
	>How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, also has a function
	min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in
	O(1) time.

>LOGIC :
	>Maintain another stack of pointers, here if we get anything lesser than at the top of pointers ka stack
	then we push another pointer in stack of pointer, pointing to new,lesser value.
	>Whenever min() is asked, this stack of pointer can immediately return.

>COULD BE BETTER :
	>No need to maintain stack of pointers, just maintain other stack , where u keep on pushing newer and 
	lesser nos that u find.

>BUG :
	>If there are multiple copies of the current min number, then the current prog doesnt maintain pointer to all
	of them.
	>>UPDATE : Just fixed this !! But didnt test the fix !!
